# Dropdown Menu

This is a solution to the take-home challenge by `<name_hidden>`. It consists of a dropdown menu component. The component supports either multi-selection or single-selection. The multi-selection menu supports selecting/deselecting in one click.

# How to run it
Have NodeJS installed. For the first run, run `npm install` once. Once the dependencies are installed, simply run `npm start`, and go to (by default) http://localhost:3000.

To test with customized props, go to App.js and modify them.

The component Dropdown takes in three parameters:

title: String,

optionList: List<String>,

multiple: Boolean.
